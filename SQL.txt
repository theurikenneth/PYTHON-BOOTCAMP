SQL - Structured Query Language
SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating (storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational database) databases.
It is designed for the retrieval and management of data in a relational database.
All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard databse language.
NB: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard.

Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. 
The fields in the Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. 
A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table.
A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. 
For example, there are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table.
A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.

SQL Execution
Using SELECT
SELECT * FROM Customers - Prints all details of Customers

SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City FROM Customers = Prints just four columns

SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City 
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID = 1
# Prints the first customer and prints 5 columns including the customer ID 1.

CREATE TABLES
The CREATE TABLE statement allows one to create a new table in a database.
E.g.
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name(
   column_1_definition,
   column_2_definition,
   ...,
   table_constraints
);

CREATE TABLE departments(
    id int,
    department_name varchar(30)
);

DROP TABLES
Allows the database to drop an existing table
E.g.
DROP TABLE table_name;

DROP TABLE departments;

SQL ALTER TABLE
* Create Table
CREATE TABLE departments(
    id int,
    department_nam varchar(30)
);
* Alter the Table - Add column
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;

ALTER TABLE departments
ADD column department_head varchar(30);

* Alter the Table - Modify column
ALTER TABLE departments
ALTER Column DateOfBirth year;

*Alter Table - Drop Column
ALTER TABLE departments 
DROP Column department_head;
